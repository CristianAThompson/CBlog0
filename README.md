# Full Stack Multi User Blog

*Hi and welcome to my multiple user blog project, we'll cover what is needed in way of programs and steps in order to run this locally.*

Alternatively you can click [Here](http://cblog89.appspot.com/login) to see the live version.

### First things required to be installed

1. The primary thing we need to have installed is [Google App Engine Launcher-Windows](https://storage.googleapis.com/appengine-sdks/featured/GoogleAppEngine-1.9.40.msi), [Google App Engine Launcher-Mac](https://storage.googleapis.com/appengine-sdks/featured/GoogleAppEngineLauncher-1.9.40.dmg), or [Google App Engine Launcher-Linux](https://storage.googleapis.com/appengine-sdks/featured/google_appengine_1.9.40.zip), alternatively you can use the command line based Google App Engine if you feel proficient with it.

### Second Where to get the files themselves

* [This](https://github.com/CristianAThompson/CBlog0.git) is the github repository where the files are located.

### How to download the files

* You can click [here](https://github.com/CristianAThompson/CBlog0/archive/master.zip) to download the zip directly, or if you prefer to use git bash to clone the repository the address for cloning the repository is found when you click the green button that says "Clone of download" on the github page that is linked above.

#### Steps to open the files locally and start the server
*Note that these steps are for the launcher with inside of Windows, although the steps within the interface should be similar cross-platform.*

1. For the First step we will need to open the Google App Engine Launcher itself, so find the icon for it and run the application, on windows it is titled _GoogleAppEngineLauncher.exe_
2. Next once it is open we will have a graphical interface, in which we will click *File->Add Exisiting Application*
3. In the next window we will select browse which will open the file browser
4. When the file browser opens navigate to the cloned/unzipped folder of the project from above and click it, do not go inside it, simply highlight the folder
5. After it is highlighted select *ok* and then click *add* you should see a new project displayed within the Launcher
6. To start the local server for this application to be viewed locally you have to click to select the application named *cblog89* and then press the *Run* button near the top of the launcher
7. After it has run you will see the Stop and Browse buttons become available, we will click the Browse button and it should open a new window/tab within our default browser directly at the blog application


###### Some sections of the code used within this application are based on code from with-in the Udacity Multi-User Blog section of the Full-Stack Nanodegree.
